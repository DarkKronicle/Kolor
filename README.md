# Kolor

Kolor allows for hard coded colors to be changed and expanded on. There are other mods that allow for Optifine compatibility, but this mod targets different colors. 

## Overlays

There are a couple overlays that Minecraft uses. Damage color, Creeper fuse, and TNT flash. Kolor allows changing of each of these separately. Look at the wiki for information on how to customize this.
